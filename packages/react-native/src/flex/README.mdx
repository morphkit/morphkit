The Flex component provides a layout container for arranging children with consistent spacing and alignment. It simplifies vertical or horizontal layouts without manual flexbox configuration, making it ideal for creating evenly-spaced content sections.

## Basic Usage

The default configuration arranges children vertically with medium spacing.

## Directions

Flex supports two direction variants for arranging children along different axes.

## Gap Sizes

Six gap spacing options are available, mapped to primitive spacing tokens.

## Alignment

Four alignment options control how children are positioned on the cross axis.

## Theme Tokens

This component uses the following design tokens from the three-tier theme system:

### Gap Tokens

| Token Path | Purpose | Value | Primitive Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| theme.component.flex.gap.none | No spacing | 0 | - |
| theme.component.flex.gap.xs | Extra small gap | 4 | primitive.spacing[1] |
| theme.component.flex.gap.sm | Small gap (default) | 8 | primitive.spacing[2] |
| theme.component.flex.gap.md | Medium gap | 16 | primitive.spacing[4] |
| theme.component.flex.gap.lg | Large gap | 24 | primitive.spacing[6] |
| theme.component.flex.gap.xl | Extra large gap | 32 | primitive.spacing[8] |

## Props

### Layout Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| direction | "horizontal" \| "vertical" | "vertical" | Main axis direction for child arrangement |
| gap | "none" \| "xs" \| "sm" \| "md" \| "lg" \| "xl" | "sm" | Spacing between children |
| align | "start" \| "center" \| "end" \| "stretch" | "stretch" | Cross-axis alignment of children |
| justify | "start" \| "center" \| "end" \| "space-between" | "start" | Main-axis distribution of children |
| wrap | boolean | false | Whether children wrap to multiple lines |

### Content Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| children | ReactNode | undefined | Child elements to arrange |

### Styling Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style | StyleProp\<ViewStyle\> | undefined | Custom style overrides |

### ViewProps

Flex extends ViewProps, so all standard View properties are supported including testID, accessibilityLabel, and other React Native View props.

## Accessibility

**Screen Reader:**

- Flex is a layout component without inherent accessibility semantics
- Child components maintain their own accessibility properties
- Use accessibilityLabel when the flex represents a logical grouping

**Visual Requirements:**

- Consistent spacing helps users understand content relationships
- Gap tokens ensure predictable visual hierarchy
