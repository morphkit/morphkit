The Spinner component provides an animated loading indicator with continuous rotation. It offers three size presets (sm, md, lg) or custom pixel sizing, with theme-aware colors that adapt to light and dark modes.

## Basic Usage

The default configuration displays a medium-sized spinner with the primary action color.

- **md**: Default 24px diameter for standard loading states

## Custom Styling

Custom numeric sizes and colors for specialized loading states.
